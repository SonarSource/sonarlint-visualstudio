## **SonarQube for IDE for Teams**

SonarQube for IDE works great as a standalone tool but you can take it to the next level by connecting it with [SonarQube Server](https://www.sonarqube.org/) or [SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/). SonarQube (Server, Cloud) analyze Pull Requests and branches in your DevOps platform (BitBucket, GitHub, Microsoft Azure, GitLab) and perform non-disruptive code quality and security checks to reliably track your codebase health. 

The 'connected mode' configuration ties SonarQube for IDE's continuous Code Quality and Code Security analysis from IDE to the entire CI/CD workflow and back again to your IDE. 



* **Common expectations for Code Quality and Code Security**

    Applied rules and analysis settings from SonarQube (Server, Cloud) are extended to SonarQube for IDE so that teams can coalesce on a shared definition of code health.

* **More rule coverage**

    When paired with SonarQube (Server, Cloud), you can benefit from additional rules for security vulnerabilities and security hotspots in IDE to identify issues earlier.

* **Smart notifications for improved quality and delivery**

    'Connected mode' sends smart alerts to individuals/teams when new issues are discovered. With everyone in the loop, issues can be addressed promptly, improving the overall software quality and delivery.
