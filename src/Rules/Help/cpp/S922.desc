<p>This rule is a strict implementation of a MISRA (Motor Industry Software Reliability Association) rule. MISRA defines best practices for developing
safety-critical software. You can learn more about this rule in the MISRA documents referenced below.</p>
<p>If you are not concerned with MISRA compliance or with safety-critical software, you might consider using rule {rule:cpp:S3135} instead ; it
targets the same kind of issue for general-purpose software.</p>
