<p>Data members and member functions cannot be defined as external, although entire objects can. When a member is declared as <code>extern</code>, the
compiler simply ignores the keyword, making it both extraneous and confusing.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class C {
  void fun();
};

extern void C::fun() { // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class C {
  void fun();
};

void C::fun() {
}
</pre>
