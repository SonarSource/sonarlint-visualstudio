<p>In addition to being difficult to use, too-long variable names can limit code portability. The ISO standard requires that variable, type, function
and label names be no more than 31 characters long.</p>
<p>Note that 31 characters is an upper bound, rather than a length recommendation. Shorter names are better, as long as theyâ€™re still
communicative.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
int this_is_a_very_long_identifier_that_definitely_should_be_renamed = 0;
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
int reasonable_identifier = 0;
</pre>
