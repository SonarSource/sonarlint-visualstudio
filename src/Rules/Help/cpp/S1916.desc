<p>The standard mentions that the line continuation character (<code>\</code>) should be immediately followed by a newline or be the very last
character of the file in order for the lines to be joined.</p>
<p>Several compilers relax this requirement by allowing whitespace after the <code>\</code> character, but this is not portable because other
compilers may not do the same.</p>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
// There should be no whitespace after the '\'
#define FOO BAR \
            BAZ
