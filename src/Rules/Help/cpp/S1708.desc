<p>C++ comments (<code>//</code>) require fewer keystrokes, and take less space. Perhaps most importantly, they do not have the nesting problems that
C-style comments do. Therefore C++ comments are preferred.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
/* this is my comment ... */

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
// this is my comment ...

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Because a C++ header file may be included by a C source file, header files are ignored by this rule.</p>
