<p>The C++ standards define some identifiers as having special meaning in specific contexts. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>final</code> and <code>override</code> since C++11 </li>
  <li> <code>module</code> and <code>import</code> since C++20 </li>
</ul>
<p>While it is technically possible to use them as normal identifiers, itâ€™s clearer for the reader of the code to consider them as if they were
keywords, and only use them with their special meaning.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
void module(int final); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
void precept(int finalValue); // Compliant
</pre>
