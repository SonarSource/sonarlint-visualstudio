<p>It is not very common for a struct to have base classes. When they do, by default, they will have public inheritance. Since this is not a fact
known by everybody, itâ€™s usually better to be explicit about the visibility of base classes in a struct.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class B {
};

struct C : B {
};
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class B {
};

struct C :  public B { // Or private, if it was public by mistake
};
</pre>
