<p>On the principle that clearer code is better code, you should explicitly <code>import</code> the things you want to use in a module. Using
<code>import *</code> imports everything in the module, and runs the risk of confusing maintainers. Similarly, <code>export * from "module";</code>
imports and then re-exports everything in the module, and runs the risk of confusing not just maintainers but also users of the module.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
import * as Imported from "aModule";  // Noncompliant
