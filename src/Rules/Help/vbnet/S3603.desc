<p>Marking a method with the <code>Pure</code> attribute specifies that the method doesn’t make any visible changes; thus, the method should return a
result, otherwise the call to the method should be equal to no-operation. So <code>Pure</code> on a <code>void</code> method is either a mistake, or
the method doesn’t do any meaningful task.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Class Person
    Private age As Integer

    &lt;Pure&gt; ' Noncompliant. In this case the method makes a possibly visible state change
    Private Sub ConfigureAge(ByVal age As Integer)
        ...
        Me.age = age
    End Sub
End Class
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Class Person
    Private age As Integer

    Private Sub ConfigureAge(ByVal age As Integer)
        Me.age = age
    End Sub
End Class
