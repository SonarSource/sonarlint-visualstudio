<p>When two methods have the same implementation, either it was a mistake - something else was intended - or the duplication was intentional, but may
be confusing to maintainers. In the latter case, one implementation should invoke the other.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Private Const CODE As String = "bounteous"
Private callCount As Integer = 0

Public Function GetCode() As String
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function

Public Function GetName() As String ' Noncompliant
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Private Const CODE As String = "bounteous"
Private callCount As Integer = 0

Public Function GetCode() As String
  callCount = callCount + 1
  Return CODE
End Function

Public Function GetName() As String
  Return GetCode()
End Function
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Empty methods, methods with only one line of code and methods with the same name (overload) are ignored.</p>
