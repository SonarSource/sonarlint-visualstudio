<p>A class with only <code>private</code> constructors canâ€™t be instantiated, thus, it seems to be pointless code.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Public Class [MyClass]
    Private Sub New() // Noncompliant
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Public Class [MyClass]
    Public Sub New()
        ' ...
    End Sub
End Class
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Classes that themselves access their private constructors (singletons or smart enums) are ignored. Classes with only <code>static</code> members
are also ignored because they are covered by Rule {rule:vbnet:S1118}.</p>
