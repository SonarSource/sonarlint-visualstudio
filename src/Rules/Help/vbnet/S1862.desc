<p>A chain of <code>If</code>/<code>ElseIf</code> statements is evaluated from top to bottom. At most, only one branch will be executed: the first one
with a condition that evaluates to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, duplicating a condition automatically leads to dead code. Usually, this is due to a copy/paste error. At best, it’s simply dead code and
at worst, it’s a bug that is likely to induce further bugs as the code is maintained, and obviously it could lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
If param = 1 Then
  OpenWindow()
ElseIf param = 2 Then
  CloseWindow()
ElseIf param = 1 Then ' Noncompliant
  MoveWindowToTheBackground()
End If
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
If param = 1 Then
  OpenWindow()
ElseIf param = 2 Then
  CloseWindow()
ElseIf param = 3 Then
  MoveWindowToTheBackground()
End If
