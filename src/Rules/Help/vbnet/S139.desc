<p>This rule verifies that single-line comments are not located at the ends of lines of code. The main idea behind this rule is that in order to be
really readable, trailing comments would have to be properly written and formatted (correct alignment, no interference with the visual structure of
the code, not too long to be visible) but most often, automatic code formatters would not handle this correctly: the code would end up less readable.
Comments are far better placed on the previous empty line of code, where they will always be visible and properly formatted.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>With the default comment pattern <code>^'\s*\S+\s*$</code>, which ignores single word comments:</p>
<pre>
Module Module1
  Sub Main()
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!") ' Noncompliant - My first program!
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!") ' CompliantOneWord
  End Sub
End Module
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Module Module1
  Sub Main()
    ' Compliant - My first program!
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!")
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!") ' CompliantOneWord
  End Sub
End Module
</pre>
