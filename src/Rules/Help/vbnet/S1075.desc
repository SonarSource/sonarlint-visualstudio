<p>Hard coding a URI makes it difficult to test a program: path literals are not always portable across operating systems, a given absolute path may
not exist on a specific test environment, a specified Internet URL may not be available when executing the tests, production environment filesystems
usually differ from the development environment, …​etc. For all those reasons, a URI should never be hard coded. Instead, it should be replaced by
customizable parameter.</p>
<p>Further even if the elements of a URI are obtained dynamically, portability can still be limited if the path-delimiters are hard-coded.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when URI’s or path delimiters are hard coded.</p>
