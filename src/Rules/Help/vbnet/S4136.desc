<p>For clarity, all overloads of the same method should be grouped together. That lets both users and maintainers quickly understand all the current
available options.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Interface IMyInterface
    Function DoTheThing() As Integer
    Function DoTheOtherThing() As String // Noncompliant
    Function DoTheThing(ByVal Path As String) As Integer
End Interface
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Interface IMyInterface
    Function DoTheThing() As Integer
    Function DoTheThing(ByVal Path As String) As Integer
    Function DoTheOtherThing() As String
End Interface
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>As it is common practice to group method declarations by implemented interface, no issue will be raised for interface implementations if grouped
together with other members of that interface.</p>
<p>As it is also a common practice to group method declarations by accessibility level, no issue will be raised for method overloads having different
access modifiers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
Class MyClass

    Private Sub DoTheThing(s As String) ' Ok - this method is declared as Private while the other one is Public
        ' ...
    End Sub

    Private Sub DoTheOtherThing(s As String)
        ' ...
    End Sub

    Public Sub DoTheThing()
        ' ...
    End Sub

End Class
