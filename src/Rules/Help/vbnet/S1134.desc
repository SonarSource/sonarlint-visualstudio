<p><code>FIXME</code> tags are commonly used to mark places where a bug is suspected, but which the developer wants to deal with later.</p>
<p>Sometimes the developer will not have the time or will simply forget to get back to that tag.</p>
<p>This rule is meant to track those tags and to ensure that they do not go unnoticed.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Function Divide(ByVal numerator As Integer, ByVal denominator As Integer) As Integer
    Return numerator / denominator  ' FIXME denominator value might be  0
End Function
</pre>
