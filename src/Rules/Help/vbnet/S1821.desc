<p>Nested <code>Select Case</code> structures are difficult to understand because you can easily confuse the cases of an inner <code>Select
Case</code> as belonging to an outer statement. Therefore nested <code>Select Case</code> statements should be avoided.</p>
<p>Specifically, you should structure your code to avoid the need for nested <code>Select Case</code> statements, but if you cannot, then consider
moving the inner <code>Select Case</code> to another function.</p>
