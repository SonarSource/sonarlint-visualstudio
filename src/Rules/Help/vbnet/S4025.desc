<p>Having a field in a child class with a name that differs from a parent class' field only by capitalization is sure to cause confusion. Such child
class fields should be renamed.</p>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This rule ignores same-name fields that are <code>Shared</code> in both the parent and child classes. It also ignores <code>Private</code> parent
class fields and fields explicitly declared as <code>Shadows</code>, but in all other such cases, the child class field should be renamed.</p>
