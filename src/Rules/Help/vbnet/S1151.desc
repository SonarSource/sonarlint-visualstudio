<p>The <code>Select...Case</code> statement should be used only to clearly define some new branches in the control flow. As soon as a case clause
contains too many statements this highly decreases the readability of the overall control flow statement. In such case, the content of the case clause
should be extracted into a dedicated procedure.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>With the default threshold of 3:</p>
<pre>
Select Case number
    Case 1 To 5 ' Noncompliant: 4 statements in the case
        MethodCall1("")
        MethodCall2("")
        MethodCall3("")
        MethodCall4("")
    Case Else
        ' ...
End Select
</pre>
