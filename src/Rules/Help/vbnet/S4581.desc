<p>When the syntax <code>new Guid()</code> (i.e. parameterless instantiation) is used, it must be that one of three things is wanted:</p>
<ol>
  <li> An empty GUID, in which case <code>Guid.Empty</code> is clearer. </li>
  <li> A randomly-generated GUID, in which case <code>Guid.NewGuid()</code> should be used. </li>
  <li> A new GUID with a specific initialization, in which case the initialization parameter is missing. </li>
</ol>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a parameterless instantiation of the <code>Guid</code> struct is found.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Public Sub Foo()
    Dim G1 As New Guid        ' Noncompliant - what's the intent?
    Dim G2 As Guid = Nothing  ' Noncompliant
End Sub
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public void Foo(byte[] bytes)
Public Sub Foo(Bytes As Byte())
    Dim G1 As Guid = Guid.Empty
    Dim G2 As Guid = Guid.NewGuid()
    Dim G3 As Guid = New Guid(Bytes)
End Sub
</pre>
