<p>Most developers expect property access to be as efficient as field access. However, if a property returns a copy of an array or collection, it will
be much slower than a simple field access, contrary to the callerâ€™s likely expectations. Therefore, such properties should be refactored into methods
so that callers are not surprised by unexpectedly poor performance.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Module Module1
    ' Internal state
    Dim array = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "strawberry"}

    ReadOnly Property Foo() As String() ' Noncompliant
        Get
            Dim copy = array.Clone      ' Expensive call
            Return copy
        End Get
    End Property
End Module
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Module Module1
    ' Internal state
    Dim array = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "strawberry"}

    Function GetFoo() As String()       ' Compliant
        Dim copy = array.Clone
        Return copy
    End Function
End Module
</pre>
