<p>There are several reasons for a method not to have a method body:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed. </li>
  <li> It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case a <code>NotSupportedException</code> should be thrown. </li>
  <li> The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Sub DoSomething()
End Sub

Function DoSomething() As String
End Function
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Sub DoSomething()
    ' Not implemented because of reason
End Sub

Function DoSomething() As String
    Throw New NotSupportedException
End Function
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>The following methods are ignored:</p>
<ul>
  <li> empty <code>Overridable</code> or <code>MustOverride</code> methods, </li>
  <li> empty methods that override an <code>MustOverride</code> method, </li>
  <li> empty overrides in test assemblies. </li>
</ul>
