<p>The use of operators pairs ( <code>=+</code> or <code>=-</code>) where the reversed, single operator was meant (<code>+=</code> or <code>-=</code>)
will compile and run, but not produce the expected results.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when <code>=+</code> or <code>=-</code> is used without any spacing between the two operators and when there is at least
one whitespace character after.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Dim target As Integer = -5
Dim num As Integer = 3

target =- num ' Noncompliant; target = -3. Is that really what's meant?
target =+ num ' Noncompliant; target = 3
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Dim target As Integer = -5
Dim num As Integer = 3

target = -num ' Compliant; intent to assign inverse value of num is clear
target += num
</pre>
