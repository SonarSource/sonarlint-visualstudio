<p>Variables can be declared with or without types. Variables declared without a type will be implicitly typed if the declaration includes an
initialization, and the compiler then type-checks every usage of typed variables. On the other hand, a variable declared with the <code>any</code>
type explicitly instructs the compiler not to do any type-checking, which is risky.</p>
<p>The <code>unknown</code> type should be preferred over the <code>any</code> type if itâ€™s not possible to have a better typing. <code>any</code>
fully disables type-checking allowing to do anything with the variable, while <code>unknown</code> requires to narrow the type before doing something
specific.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
let a = 42;  // implicitly typed to number
let b: number = 42;  // explicitly typed to number
let c: any = 42;  // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
let a = 42;
let b: number = 42;
let c: number = 42;
</pre>
