<p>Trailing whitespaces are simply useless and should not stay in code. They may generate noise when comparing different versions of the same
file.</p>
<p>If you encounter issues from this rule, this probably means that you are not using an automated code formatter - which you should if you have the
opportunity to do so.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
// The following string will error if there is a whitespace after '\'
var str = "Hello \
World";
</pre>
<h2>Deprecated</h2>
<p>This rule is deprecated, and will eventually be removed.</p>
