<p>When a function is designed to return an invariant value, it may be poor design, but it shouldnâ€™t adversely affect the outcome of your program.
However, when it happens on all paths through the logic, it is likely a mistake.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a function contains several <code>return</code> statements that all return the same value.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
function foo(a) {  // Noncompliant
  let b = 12;
  if (a) {
    return b;
  }
  return b;
}
</pre>
