<p><code>enum</code>s are usually used to identify distinct elements in a set of values. However <code>enum</code>s can be treated as bit fields and
bitwise operations can be used on them to combine the values. This is a good way of specifying multiple elements of set with a single value. When
<code>enum</code>s are used this way, it is a best practice to mark the <code>enum</code> with the <code>FlagsAttribute</code>.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
enum Permissions
{
  None = 0,
  Read = 1,
  Write = 2,
  Execute = 4
}
// ...

var x = Permissions.Read | Permissions.Write;  // Noncompliant; enum is not marked with [Flags]
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
[Flags]
enum Permissions
{
  None = 0,
  Read = 1,
  Write = 2,
  Execute = 4
}
// ...

var x = Permissions.Read | Permissions.Write;
</pre>
