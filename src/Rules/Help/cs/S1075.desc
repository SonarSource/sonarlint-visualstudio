<p>Hardcoding a URI makes it difficult to test a program: path literals are not always portable across operating systems, a given absolute path may
not exist on a specific test environment, a specified Internet URL may not be available when executing the tests, production environment filesystems
usually differ from the development environment, …​etc. For all those reasons, a URI should never be hardcoded. Instead, it should be replaced by
customizable parameter.</p>
<p>Further even if the elements of a URI are obtained dynamically, portability can still be limited if the path-delimiters are hardcoded.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when URI’s or path delimiters are hardcoded.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This rule does not raise an issue when an ASP.NET virtual path is passed as an argument to one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> methods: <code>System.Web.HttpServerUtilityBase.MapPath()</code>, <code>System.Web.HttpRequestBase.MapPath()</code>,
  <code>System.Web.HttpResponseBase.ApplyAppPathModifier()</code>, <code>System.Web.Mvc.UrlHelper.Content()</code> </li>
  <li> all methods of: <code>System.Web.VirtualPathUtility</code> </li>
  <li> constructors of: <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.VirtualFileResult</code>, <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing.VirtualPathData</code> </li>
</ul>
