<p>Most of the time a block of code is empty when a piece of code is really missing. So such empty block must be either filled or removed.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 42; i++){}  // Empty on purpose or missing piece of code ?
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>When a block contains a comment, this block is not considered to be empty.</p>
