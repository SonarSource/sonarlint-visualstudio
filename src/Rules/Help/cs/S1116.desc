<p>Empty statements, i.e. <code>;</code>, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten. </li>
  <li> There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
void DoSomething()
{
    ; // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

void DoSomethingElse()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");;  // Noncompliant - double ;
    // ...
    // Rarely, they are used on purpose as the body of a loop. It is a bad practice to
    // have side-effects outside of the loop:
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; Console.WriteLine(i), i++); // Noncompliant
    // ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
void DoSomething()
{
}

void DoSomethingElse()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    // ...
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
     }
    // ...
}
