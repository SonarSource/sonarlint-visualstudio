<p>Calling <code>GC.Collect</code> is rarely necessary, and can significantly affect application performance. That’s because it triggers a blocking
operation that examines <em>every object in memory</em> for cleanup. Further, you don’t have control over when this blocking cleanup will actually
run.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the consequences of calling this method far outweigh the benefits unless perhaps you’ve just triggered some event that is unique
in the run of your program that caused a lot of long-lived objects to die.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when <code>GC.Collect</code> is invoked.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
static void Main(string[] args)
{
  // ...
  GC.Collect(2, GCCollectionMode.Optimized); // Noncompliant
}
