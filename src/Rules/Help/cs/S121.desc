<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
// the two statements seems to be attached to the if statement, but that is only true for the first one:
if (condition)
  ExecuteSomething();
  CheckSomething();
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
if (condition)
{
  ExecuteSomething();
  CheckSomething();
}
