<p>When an object has a field annotated with <code>ThreadStatic</code>, that field is shared within a given thread, but unique across threads. Since a
class' static initializer is only invoked for the first thread created, it also means that only the first thread will have the expected initial
values.</p>
<p>Instead, allow such fields to be initialized to their default values or make the initialization lazy.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class Foo
{
  [ThreadStatic]
  public static object PerThreadObject = new object(); // Noncompliant. Will be null in all the threads except the first one.
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public class Foo
{
  [ThreadStatic]
  public static object _perThreadObject;
  public static object PerThreadObject
  {
    get
    {
      if (_perThreadObject == null)
      {
        _perThreadObject = new object();
      }
      return _perThreadObject;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
