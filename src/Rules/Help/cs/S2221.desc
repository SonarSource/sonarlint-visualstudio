<p>Catching <code>System.Exception</code> seems like an efficient way to handle multiple possible exceptions. Unfortunately, it traps all exception
types, including the ones that were not intended to be caught. To prevent any misunderstandings, the exception filters should be used. Alternatively
each exception type should be in a separate <code>catch</code> block.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
try
{
  // do something that might throw a FileNotFoundException or IOException
}
catch (Exception e) // Noncompliant
{
  // log exception ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
try
{
  // do something
}
catch (Exception e) when (e is FileNotFoundException || e is IOException)
{
  // do something
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>The final option is to catch <code>System.Exception</code> and <code>throw</code> it in the last statement in the <code>catch</code> block. This is
the least-preferred option, as it is an old-style code, which also suffers from performance penalty compared to exception filters.</p>
<pre>
try
{
  // do something
}
catch (Exception e)
{
  if (e is FileNotFoundException || e is IOException)
  {
    // do something
  }
  else
  {
    throw;
  }
}
</pre>
