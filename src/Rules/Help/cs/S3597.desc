<p>The <code>ServiceContract</code> attribute specifies that a class or interface defines the communication contract of a Windows Communication
Foundation (WCF) service. The service operations of this class or interface are defined by <code>OperationContract</code> attributes added to methods.
It doesnâ€™t make sense to define a contract without any service operations; thus, in a <code>ServiceContract</code> class or interface at least one
method should be annotated with <code>OperationContract</code>. Similarly, WCF only serves <code>OperationContract</code> methods that are defined
inside <code>ServiceContract</code> classes or interfaces; thus, this rule also checks that <code>ServiceContract</code> is added to the containing
type of <code>OperationContract</code> methods.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
[ServiceContract]
interface IMyService // Noncompliant
{
  int MyServiceMethod();
}

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
[ServiceContract]
interface IMyService
{
  [OperationContract]
  int MyServiceMethod();
