<p>A nested type is a type argument that is also a generic type. Calling a method with such a nested type argument requires complicated and confusing
code. It should be avoided as much as possible.</p>

    public void DoSomething(ICollection&lt;ICollection&lt;int&gt;&gt; outerCollect) // Noncompliant
