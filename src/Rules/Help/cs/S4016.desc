<p>If an <code>enum</code> memberâ€™s name contains the word "reserved" it implies it is not currently used and will be change in the future. However
changing an <code>enum</code> member is a breaking change and can create significant problems. There is no need to reserve an <code>enum</code> member
since a new member can be added in the future, and such an addition will usually not be a breaking change.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the name of an enumeration member contains "reserved".</p>
