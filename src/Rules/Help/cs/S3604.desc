<p>Fields, properties and events can be initialized either inline or in the constructor. Initializing them inline and in the constructor at the same
time is redundant; the inline initialization will be overridden.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class Person
{
  int age = 42; // Noncompliant
  public Person(int age)
  {
    this.age = age;
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class Person
{
  int age;
  public Person(int age)
  {
    this.age = age;
  }
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>This rule doesnâ€™t report an issue if not all constructors initialize the field. If the field is initialized inline to its default value, then
{rule:csharpsquid:S3052} already reports an issue on the initialization.</p>
