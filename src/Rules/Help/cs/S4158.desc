<p>When a collection is empty it makes no sense to access or iterate it. Doing so anyway is surely an error; either population was accidentally
omitted or the developer doesnâ€™t understand the situation.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when any use is made of an empty collection other than the following ignored calls: <code>Add</code>,
<code>AddRange</code>, <code>Equals</code>, <code>GetHashCode</code>.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
var strings = new List&lt;string&gt;();

strings.Remove("bar");  // Noncompliant

if (strings.Contains("foo")) {}  // Noncompliant

foreach (var str in strings) {}  // Noncompliant
</pre>
