<p>Correctly updating a <code>static</code> field from a non-static method is tricky to get right and could easily lead to bugs if there are multiple
class instances and/or multiple threads in play.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue each time a <code>static</code> field is updated from a non-static method or property.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class MyClass
{
  private static int count = 0;

  public void DoSomething()
  {
    //...
    count++;  // Noncompliant
  }
}
</pre>
