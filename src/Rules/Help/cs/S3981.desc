<p>The size of a collection and the length of an array are always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a size or length is greater than or
equal to zero doesnâ€™t make sense, since the result is always <code>true</code>. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return
<code>false</code>. Perhaps the intent was to check the non-emptiness of the collection or array instead.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
if(collection.Count &gt;= 0){...}

if(enumerable.Count() &lt; 0){...}

if(array.Length &gt;= 0){...}

bool result = array.Length &gt;=0;
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
if (list.Any()) { ... }

if (list.Count &gt; 0) { ... }

if (array.Length &gt;= 42) { ... }
</pre>
