<p>When logging a message there are several important requirements which must be fulfilled:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The user must be able to easily retrieve the logs </li>
  <li> The format of all logged message must be uniform to allow the user to easily read the log </li>
  <li> Logged data must actually be recorded </li>
  <li> Sensitive data must only be logged securely </li>
</ul>
<p>If a program directly writes to the standard outputs, there is absolutely no way to comply with those requirements. Thatâ€™s why defining and using a
dedicated logger is highly recommended.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
private void DoSomething()
{
    // ...
    Console.WriteLine("so far, so good..."); // Noncompliant
    // ...
}
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>The following are ignored by this rule:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Console Applications </li>
  <li> Calls in methods decorated with <code>[Conditional ("DEBUG")]</code> </li>
  <li> Calls included in DEBUG preprocessor branches (<code>#if DEBUG</code>) </li>
</ul>
