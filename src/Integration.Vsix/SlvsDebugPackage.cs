/**************************************************************
 * DEBUG-only package to help with local debugging of SLVS 2019
 **************************************************************
 *
 * We can't open or build the SLVS solution in VS2019 any more (we use new
 * MSBuild features that are not supported).
 *
 * 1. Close all VS2022 instances
 * 2. Open a VS *2022* Developer Command Prompt
 * 2. Build SLVS using the following command:
 *
 *      msbuild /p:vstargetversion=2019 /t:restore,rebuild
 *
 * 3. Install the resulting SLVS2019 vsix locally.
 * 4. Re-open the SLVS solution in VS2022
 * 5. Open a VS *2019* Developer Command Prompt
 * 6. Set the required environment variable using the following command:
 *
 *   set SLVSDEBUG=anything
 *
 * 7. Start VS2019 from the command line (devenv.exe)
 *
 * When VS loads this package and hits the Debugger.Launch call Windows
 * will pop up a dialogue asking if you want to attach a debugger.
 * Select the instance of VS2022 you opened in step (4) above.
 *
 * The SLVS 2019 pdbs should match the assemblies being used by VS2019, so
 * you should be able to debug normally i.e. setting breaking point,
 * stepping through code etc.
 *
 * If this package is loaded too late, you can put System.Debugger.Launch
 * calls before the specific code you want to debug.
