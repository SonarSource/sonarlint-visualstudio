/* 
 * Instancing: a new instance of this class should be created for each analysis request.
 * 
 * The class is initialized with the text snapshot representing the state of the text buffer
 * at the point the analysis was triggered.
 * 
 * The job of the class is to:
 * 1) map the issue start/end positions supplied by the analyzer to spans in the supplied text snapshot, and 
 * 2) accumulate the list of issues that have return by the analyzer so far
 * 
 * Each time IIssueConsumer.Accept is called, the new issues will be mapped back to the
 * supplied snapshot and decorated with the additional data required for filtering and tagging.
 * Then, all of the issues that have been received so far will be passed to the OnIssuesChanged delegate.
 * 
 * However, it's possible that the text buffer could have been edited since the analysis
 * was triggered. It is the responsibility of the callback to translate the supplied IssueVisualizations
 * to the current text buffer snapshot, if necessary.
 * 
 * 
 * Mapping from reported issue line/char positions to the analysis snapshot
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Currently, the JS/CFamily analyzers run against the file on disc, not the content of 
 * the snapshot. We're assuming that analysis is triggered on save so the state of the
 * text snapshot matches the file on disc which is being analyzed.
 * We expect always to be able to map back from the reported issue to the snapshot.
 * However, we code defensively and strip out any issues that can't be mapped.
