    // unique identifiers:
    //
    // * plugin : a container for different types of extension
    //
    // * language : A language is defined in a single plugin but can be consumed by multiple
    //              e.g. the CSharp language is defined in the SonarC# plugin, with additional
    //              rules for the language being defined in the SonarC# Security plugin.
    //
    // * repository: a container for rule definitions. A repository provides rules for a single language.
    //
    // * rule definition: part of a single repository. The full rule id is given by "[repo id]:[rule id]"
